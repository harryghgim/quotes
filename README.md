# quotes

## Welcome to my random quote machine üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

I made this program as [one of MDN Front End Development Libraries Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine).

## Data
Since it's a small project, rather than putting in a separate database, I put the data directly in `quotes.json`. All quotes are derived from [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes).
